# The Universe of Birdy

Little Birdy lives in a beautiful house with all his brothers and sisters. They have divided all the things that need to be done around the house and Birdy is in charge of taking care of the garden and the veggies, so there is always something to eat.

## 1. Birdy Wakes Up

Every day when Birdy wakes up, his personal assistant, Leo, informs him about the different tasks to be accomplished during the day.

```
> Leo: Good morning, Birdy! Did you sleep well?
```

```
> Birdy: Yes, I did! What needs to be done today?
```

```
> Leo: Today you will help Miss Bee in the garden with the following tasks:

1) Collect ripe broccoli
2) Water dry carrots
3) Plant 10 aubergines

Where would you like to start? (1, 2, 3)
```

```
> Birdy: I would like to start with number 1, collecting the broccoli.
```

```
> Leo: That is a great choice. I will be here while you collect the broccoli. Save some energy to accomplish these tasks later:

2) Water dry carrots
3) Plant 10 aubergines

Good luck!
```

_**Hint:** This is an example of how the conversation above should appear in the terminal:_

Before he gets out of the house, he always has a look at the map of the universe to know the different stops he needs to make upfront:

## 2. Birdy greets Dr. Octopus

Birdy has little memory and he always goes first to greet Dr. Octopus. She is the wise mind of the universe and she knows everything.

```
> Dr. Octopus: Good morning, Birdy.
Which veggie will you be working on today? (1, 2, 3)

1) Broccoli
2) Carrots
3) Aubergines
```

```
> Birdy: Good morning, Dr. Octopus.
Today I need to work on the broccoli, number 3.
```

```
> Dr. Octopus: Mmmm... broccoli!
What do you need to do with them? (1, 2, 3)

1) Collect them
2) Water them
3) Plant them
```

```
> Birdy: I will be collecting the ripe broccoli, number 1.
```

```
> Dr. Octopus: In that case you need to go to the Broccoli Republic. Mr. Owlie will be waiting for you there. He is the housekeeper of the republic and will give you the right key to collect the broccoli.
```

```
> Birdy: Thank you, Dr. Octopus. You always know the way!
```

```
> Dr. Octopus: Do not forget to tell Mr. Owlie that I sent you and that you are there to help Miss Bee with the garden. Good luck!
```






## 3. Birdy meets Mr. Owlie

Mr. Owlie is the housekeeper of the Republic. He doesn't do much during the day, apart from staying at the reception desk and waiting for people to come for visit. But he knows everything and everyone in the Republic, so if you ever need to do anything around there, you'd better talk to him first! He will recommend you to the appropriate person ;-)

He has a little secret: he doesn't like veggies at all! So he makes sure not to touch them ever and let the others do the hard work. He can get cranky quite easy, so just be friends with him!

```
> Mr. Owlie: Good morning, Sir. May I help you?
```

```
> Birdy: Good morning, Mr. Owlie. My name is Birdy and I am here to help Miss Bee with the garden. Dr. Octopus sent me here.
```

```
> Mr. Owlie: Nice, nice! May I ask what will you be doing with the broccoli?
I need to know before giving you the key to open the right door of the garden. (1, 2, 3)

1) Collect them
2) Water them
3) Plant them
```

```
> Birdy: I will be collecting the ripe broccoli, number 1.
```

```
> Mr. Owlie: Here it is the right key to collect the broccoli. Please give it to Miss Bee when you are at the garden. Ok?
```

```
> Birdy: Ok! Thank you, Mr. Owlie. I will save it inside my balloon!
```

```
> Mr. Owlie: When you finish to collect the broccoli, don't forget to visit Mrs. Doris. She is the librarian of the Republic and will make a nice confirmation letter for you, including beautiful drawings full of broccoli!

We need to keep track of all the things that happen around the garden. Afterwards we need to give that information forward to the accountant of the Republic.

Have fun with Miss Bee!
```

```
> Birdy: See you later, Mr. Owlie!
```







## 4. Birdy helps Miss Bee

Miss Bee loves gardening and veggies. She is very hard working and spends her days doing all kind of things to make her garden the most beautiful in the universe. Oh, and she also makes the most delicious honey!

Birdy knows her since a long time and they are best friends. They enjoy their time playing together, not only in the garden, but also around the whole universe.

[![](http://cd.sseu.re/04_birdy_helps_miss_bee_gray.png)](http://cd.sseu.re/04_birdy_helps_miss_bee_gray.png)

```
> Miss Bee: Hi, Birdy! I am so happy to see you.
I can see that you are here to collect the broccoli.
Is that right?
```

```
> Birdy: Hello, Bee. That's right! Will you help me with it?
```

```
> Miss Bee: Sure thing! Please give me the key.
```

```
> Birdy: Let's do this! I will be saving all the broccoli inside my balloon...
```








## 5. Birdy visits Mrs. Doris

Mrs. Doris is the librarian of the Republic. You will find her writing stories all day long or reading one of her thousands books.

Everyone has a little secret in this universe: Mrs. Doris likes to look super pretty all the time!

[![](http://cd.sseu.re/05_birdy_visits_mrs_doris_gray.png)](http://cd.sseu.re/05_birdy_visits_mrs_doris_gray.png)

```
> Birdy: Good morning, Mrs. Doris. My name is Birdy and I am here to get a confirmation letter. I just collected all the ripe broccoli from the garden with the help of Miss Bee. Mr. Owlie mentioned that you could also do some beautiful drawings full of broccoli.
```

```
> Mrs. Doris: Nice to meet you, Birdy. Please give a second while I prepare the letter for you. May I know how many broccoli did you collect today?
```

```
> Birdy: I collected 17 broccoli.
```

```
> Mrs. Doris: Let me prepare 17 drawings then! Just a second, I am a bit slow...
My CSS pencils are most of the times a bit disorganized. Some of them are even duplicated.
Sorry for the mess!
```

```
> Birdy: No problem, I am not in a rush.
(Although Leo might be already waiting for a response from me...)
```

```
> Mrs. Doris: I am done! Over here! This is your letter.
Have a safe trip back home. Come back soon, Birdy!
```

```
> Birdy: Thank you, Mrs. Doris!
```






## 6. Birdy comes back home

Back home, Leo is already waiting for Birdy. He makes sure that all the broccoli is good enough to be cooked. The kitchen is all set to start preparing lunch!

[![](http://cd.sseu.re/06_birdy_comes_home_gray.png)](http://cd.sseu.re/06_birdy_comes_home_gray.png)

```
> Leo: Welcome back, Birdy! Did you collect the broccoli?
```

```
> Birdy: Yes, I did! Please have a look.
```

```
> Leo: Mmmm... it looks so tasty and smells soooo good!
I will send it to the kitchen right away.
```

```
> Birdy: What do I need to do next?
```

```
> Leo: You can choose between these tasks: (2, 3)

2) Water dry carrots
3) Plant 10 aubergines
```

```
> Birdy: I am ready to water the dry carrots, number 2!
```
